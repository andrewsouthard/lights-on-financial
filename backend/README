INSTALLATION

NOTE: Perl 5.8 or greater must be installed on the system before beginning!

Install the prerequisites by running the following command:

bash localSetup.sh

This will install all required Perl modules in the current directory without affecting
the system configuration.


USAGE

Download QFX/OFX files from your financial institutions. This is usually under the transactions
or transactions history section of the website. Make sure to select the date range you would
like to generate a spreadsheet for.

Once your QFX/OFX files have been downloaded, run the import command for each file:

perl import.pl myfile.QFX

After all files have been imported, run the following command to generate an Excel spreadsheet:

perl outToSpreadsheet.pl

The resulting spreadsheet will be in the current directory with the name budget-spreadsheet.xlsx.
